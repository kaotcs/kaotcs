## Data Science Projects

* ### [Rossman Store Sales](https://github.com/kaotcs/rossmann_sales_prediction)

    Sales projection for a retail chain to predict the total amount of sales for the next 6 weeks. This analyzes is crucial, since the retail chain seeks to analyze its expantion and the performance of currently stores portfolio.
